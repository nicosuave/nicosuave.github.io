title: About Nico
---
I'm a software developer. I study Informatics with a specialization in Software Engineering at UC Irvine, live in Irvine, and work at Hedgeye. I believe in no frills, to-the-point user experiences. I always try to keep learning with an open mind.

I enjoy trying new India Pale Ales, cooking, capsaicin, being outdoors, and live music. I probably spend more time than is healthy on my laptop.

I've enjoyed building things since I was 12 (I've improved tremendously since then, don't worry). Albeit, I may have struggled programming through my early teenage years without any formal instruction, nor the willingness to learn structured programming. I preferred to copy & paste code. Now, I enjoy hearing as many talks as I can, and attending [OCRuby](http://www.meetup.com/ocruby/) when I have the chance.
