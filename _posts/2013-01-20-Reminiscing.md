I think this was 2004. I decided that vBulletin would be the backend for my site, so I acquired a copy online. Seeing as I was fourteen at the time, I didn't have an extra few hundred dollars lying around for a license. At the time, the primary way to make modifications to your board was to apply a "mod", which was usually composed of adding a few php files, and LOTS of find & replace. 

It was ahead of its time. This was during a a pre-Facebook era. I think that "Nico Ritschel Dot Com" perhaps even predated general Myspace use among my peers. At it's peak, my peers had made over 10,000 posts. I added flash games with competitive features (Thanks, vBulletin mod author!), and my 8th grade friends did their gaming on my site. 

I even figured, why not add some Adsense ads? Now, I won't speculate on the legitimacy of the clicks on those ads, but I eventually did receieve a $150 check from Google. I was excited that I actually made money online. Then I spent that money on a 120GB Western Digital Black drive. At the time, I was very interested in building computers, and things like fast hard drives tickled my fancy.

And now things have come full circle. NicoRitschel.com is back. Albeit, in a different form.
