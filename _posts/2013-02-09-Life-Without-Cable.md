I haven't had cable tv in almost four years. I must admit, I don't miss it at all. I can watch most shows via streaming services (now usually the next day, instead of the next week). 

Alternatively, for programs not offered on streaming services, I am forced to seek out a surprisingly professional x264-encoded recording (sometimes this is available prior to PST airtime, due to the time difference. I really prefer this approach (and the advertisements are removed for me), but does the content provider lose out? Is this any different from skipping the advertisements using a DVR? Cable companies are a dying infrastructure. Media outlets love direct online distribution, and big tech names like Intel and Google are trying to get in on the action with a unique take.

Personally, I'm interested in Google's take and seemingly roadmapped media delivery, by means of providing infrastructure through Google Fiber. I love how the internet enables all sorts of user-contributed content to reach such a broad audience. The quality of content is truly increasing at a rapid pace, and the ability to do things such as live stream is phoenominal. It takes quite an infrastructure to accomplish that sort of feat, at that scale. One can hope that traditional media entirely collapses in favor of aggregating news with a dimension many orders of magnitude greater than that the former.
