<h2>{{ page.title }}</h2>

I'm a software developer. I study Informatics with a specialization in Software Engineering at UC Irvine, and work at [Hedgeye](http://hedgeye.com/). I'm a strong believer in no frills, to-the-point user experiences. I try to approach problems with an open mind, and I keep myself busy hacking away on all sorts of things.

I enjoy trying new India Pale Ales, cooking, capsaicin, being outdoors, and live music. I probably spend more time than is healthy on my laptop.

I've enjoyed building things since I was 14 (see my [blog post](/Reminiscing.html)). Albeit, I may have struggled programming through my early teenage years without any formal instruction, nor the willingness to learn structured programming. I preferred to copy & paste code. Now, I enjoy hearing as many talks as I can, and attending [OCRuby](http://www.meetup.com/ocruby/) when I have the chance.
