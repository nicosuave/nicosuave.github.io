Hi, I'm Nico. I'm a software developer. I study Informatics with a specialization in Software Engineering at UC Irvine. I'm a strong believer in no frills, to-the-point user experiences.

I enjoy trying new India Pale Ales, cooking, capsaicin, being outdoors, and watching live music. I probably spend more time than is healthy on my laptop.

I've enjoyed building things since I was 14 (see my [blog post](/Reminiscing.html)). Albeit, I may have struggled programming through my early teenage years without any formal instruction, nor the willingness to learn structured programming. Now, I enjoy learning from as many experts as I can, and attending [OCRuby Meetups](http://www.meetup.com/ocruby/) when I have the chance.

My résumé is available for [download](/pdfs/resume.pdf "Résumé, Nico Ritschel")
